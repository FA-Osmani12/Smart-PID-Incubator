# Smart-PID-Incubator

This is a complete arduino code of my Smart PID controlled Incubator Version -1.0
Here i have used the following components and tools--
1) ESP-32 
2) DHT-22
3) L298(Using Mosfet can be more cost efficient)
4) DC Bulb as heating element (here i used motor bike headlight)
5) 0.96 OLED display
6) Arduino IDE.
7) BLYNK IOT app for remote monitoring and notfication alert.
